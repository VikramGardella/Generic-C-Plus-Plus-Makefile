# Generic-C-Plus-Plus-Makefile
Uses g++ compiler to produce an executable from all relevant and specified files for a C++ project when utilizing a Unix console/terminal.

Leave this file as "Makefile" with the uppercase "M" because this is automatically detected and interpreted as a C++ "Makefile" by the Unix terminal (and maybe also in Windows' "Command Prompt"). Once this is in the same directory/folder as the project you wish to compile, just enter "make" (all lowercase) in the Unix terminal.
